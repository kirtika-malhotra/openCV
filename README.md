# OpenCV
this repo covers the basics of openCV 

few facts about images:
- bmp requires 8 bits per channel while PNG allows either 8 or 16 bits per channel.
- Generally a pixel is typically represented by one byte per channel.
- image[0, 0] or image[0, 0, 0]. The first index is the pixel's  **y coordinate** , or row, 0 being the top. The second index is the pixel's **x coordinate**, or column, 0 being the leftmost. The third index (if applicable) represents a color
- There are broadly 5 video formats:
  1) AVI(audio video interleave file): large file and good quality video
  2) MPEG- MPEG is a common digital video format use for audio and video compression and transmission.
  3) Motion-JPEG(MJPEG)- Motion JPEG or MJPEG (MJPG) is a video format in which video frames are compressed individually as JPEG images. The format is widely used by digital cameras, webcams, and other video recorders and is supported by most web browsers, PlayStation, and the QuickTime player.
  4) Ogg Vorbis- It is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free, general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality.
  5) Flash Video-It is a container file format used to deliver digital video content (e.g., TV shows, movies, etc.) over the Internet using Adobe Flash Player
